# GPT-4-Voice-Image-Interaction-Project

## Project Overview

This project consists of two main Python scripts: `pic.py` and `script.py`, which together create an interactive system using image and voice processing. The system captures images using a camera and interacts with the GPT-4 model using voice and text processing techniques.

### `pic.py` - Camera Image Capture

- **Functionality**: Opens the computer's camera and captures the current frame at set intervals.
- **Output**: Saves the captured image frames in the `images` folder.

### `script.py` - Main Interaction Script

This script is divided into three main modules:

1. **Voice to Text**
   - Converts the user's voice input into text format.

2. **Text and Image Processing**
   - Combines the text provided by the user with the images captured by `pic.py`, and inputs them into the GPT-4 model.
   - The GPT-4 model processes these inputs and returns a text result.

3. **Text to Voice**
   - Converts the text output from the GPT-4 model into voice and plays it back to the user.

### Existing Issue

- **Lengthy Voice Output**: When the text generated by the GPT-4 model is long, the voice output is also lengthy. This leads to an inability to interrupt the voice playback promptly when needed by the user.
